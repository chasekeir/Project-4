My favorite interaction is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs40_2022fall/comments/z5io7b/comment/ixwobow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I like this interaction because of the relationship between Biden and Obama, and the non-seriousness of the reply to my original comment about Obama

I completed the 6 tasks in the <code>bot.py</code> file for the 12 points it was worth. I also completed this github repo for the 3 points it was worth. I also completed recieving the 1000 valid comments as can be seen above so that rewards me another 10 points. I completed the <code>bot_vote.py</code> file and use the textblob sentiment analysis for the 4 extra credit points it is worth and let it run to upvote comments and submissions related to Biden. I also completed the <code>bot_submissions.py</code> for the 2 extra credit points it was worth. I drew my submissions from the "Liberal" subreddit. Overall, my score should be a 31/30 for the work I put in on the required steps as well as the extra credits I was able to complete.
